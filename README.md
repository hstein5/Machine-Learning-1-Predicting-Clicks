# Machine-Learning-1-Predicting-Clicks

This project examines many different possible approaches that can be taken to predict the
probability of a click for on-line advertisements. We tried multiple classification methods to
determine a best model, including decision trees, logistic regression, neural networks and
XGBoost. Before modeling, we did some data cleaning and manipulation on both our training
and test data sets, including splitting our training data into smaller samples since the original data
set contains over 30 million observations.
